Rebol2-PBKDF2
=============

This is Implementation of PBKDF2 in Rebol.

I needed Rebol native "Password-Based Key Derivation Function" for long time. But it turns out it's really easy to implement.

Based on this code, which seemed far the cleanest. https://defuse.ca/php-pbkdf2.htm

Conversion to 4 byte endians uses function from wonderful: http://www.codeconscious.com/rebol/tips-and-techniques.html

Should be easy to turn to Rebol3 and Red when the time comes.
